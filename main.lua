--[[
    mineswept is a minesweeper clone where you are guaranteed to lose
    on the second move. that is, unless you start a normal game with a
    hidden key combo.

    can be played with either mouse or keyboard.

    soon to be a widget!

    x   * starting new game returns cursor to centre screen
    x   * start new game keep map centred
    x   * memory leak?
    x   * going oob on menu board dimensions falsly updates mines
    x   * can't create board with d < 8; can create, just forgot to clear previous boards
    x   * losing during cord causes false flag to have incorrect sprite (reveal then cord is issue?)
    x   * secret fairness 2 needs to reset to menu fairness upon returning to menu
    x   * menu button prompts change depending on current input method
    x       > menu mouse inputs
    x   * hide cursor on menu
    -   * start in mouse false mode
    x   * fix cruel mode deleting flags adjacent to first reveal
    x   * on insidious, game over also runs second gen
    * allow insidious gens not in corners
    x   * lshift also pans/speeds up cursor
    x   * get tighter bounds for insidious through smart reflection of 3x2
    -   * insidious loses on the n + mth move (allow moves that result in further 50-50s)
    * demo game with set board to showcase colours...but it's actually insiidous
    x   * show win-loss ratio on gameover screen
    x       > write to appdata
    x       > reset by through grave on menu/gameover?
    * title on menu screen?
    x   * don't reset cursor to centre screen if playing again
    x       > track previous gamestate
    x   * move random 50-50 selection into fifties
    x        > add weight to given types
    x   * find clever way of compressing similar layouts
    xxxx   * fix insidious gen starting on non-0 due to inideal 50-50 placement
    x   * draw a border around the board
    xx   * insidious 50 cell that is included in fair gen; a zero?
    -   * better 50 choice by allowing larger boards depending on first reveal location;
    -     actually, that would go poorly for very large 50s on small board.
    -     the board would be overwhelmed by the 50 if cursor was in the corner
    x   * key bind to lose game
    - adjustable window size

    * refactor board
    x       > better tile manipulation logic (clean functions, no if tile(is_flag_false) lying about)
        > move board to memory to allow alternative sprite sets?
            - or simply wrap mg/set functions?
            - infinite board (for quantum) might not work using map
        > small sprites!

    * quantum minesweeper
        > infinite board
        > density of mines, not count of mines
        > board is generated as play progresses
        > always results in a valid board
        > difficulty chooses probability of random choice succeeding
            - easy:     guaranteed success (where possible)
            - normal:   1/rho chance of success
            - hard:     guaranteed loss (where possible)
        > victory is tracked through tiles revealed
        > what is minimum density to prevent an infinite reveal?

        > the whole idea behind quantum mineswept arose when i notices a similarity
          between qm and insidious 50-50 mine placement.
          the mines exist in all possible variants until the user chooses;
          by observing a cell, the wav function collapses.
          plus, it's quantised! there is not continuous amount of mines.
          that said, there's no analogue for the uncertainty principle, as far as i see.
        > it turns out, there are at least 4 other projects out there
          that call themselves "quantum minesweeper". i'm not a genius after all

    * quantum mineswept issues that need to be solved...
        > general quantum mines
            - place a mine if...
                + the mine is guaranteed
                + the user observes the cell (and fails the probability check)
            - kicks the question back: how to tell if a mine is guaranteed?
                + just place mines and reset until it is invalid, lol
        > how to maintain an 'infinite' grid
            - policy for very distant, isolated reveals
        > minimum desnity to guarantee finite (and sensible) first reveal
        > how the heck do i generate any frontier? what happens on the initial reveal?

    * observations about quantum mines...
        > imagine each possible variation was tracked
            - no matter the variation, every revealed cell would see the same number
              of mines in each variation
